If you are thinking of going to Brazil for your holiday. Here is one major tip for you, take out your dancing shoes. Brazilians love dancing. So here we go, two famous types of dance in brazil. The first one 桑巴舞, samba, right! So samba is our traditional kind of dance. It's usually performed in big festivals and famous carnival. It's not a coupe dance like some people think. It's actually a fast-paced dance and I will show you one of the quick steps. The feet are very important, but you can't see it today. So this is samba, The second type of dance is called Forro. And that's my personal favorite. Forro is a coupe dance, people confused it with salsa, but it's not salsa. Forro is a very Brazilian style of dance. It's a coupe dance. But it's much slower and much more relaxed. The basic step is pretty much like this. And if you go to brazil, you might want to practice this one.
